# FCast Sender

A `sender` is a device or software application that discovers and communicates with a `receiver`. The sender uses the FCast protocol to send media content to the receiver, such as a TV, media top box, or desktop.
The sender initiates the media streaming by connecting to the receiver, launching the media, and then the receiver begins playing the media. Once the media is launched, the sender can control the playback, allowing operations like pause, resume, seek, and volume adjustment.

Sender applications that are currently available:

* [**Grayjay**](https://grayjay.app/) is a player that exposes multiple video websites as sources in the app.
* [**Terminal**](/sender/terminal/) sender allows you use the FCast protocol over the command line interface.
